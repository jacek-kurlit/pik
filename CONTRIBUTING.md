Pik is a volunteer effort. We encourage you to pitch in and help to push its development further. 

You do not need X years of rust production experience (main maintainer does not qualify either!) 

If you want to help, find an issue you are interested in and let us know that you want to solve it. 

If you want to add new features, please create GitHub issue first to have discussion about it first. 

Thank you for considering helping us!
